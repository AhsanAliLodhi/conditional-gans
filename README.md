# conditional-gans
This project is the pytorch implementation of conditional gans. The purpose of the project is to deploy a single model that can translate images into multiple domains (weathers) by only modifying a conditional variable on some real world dataset. You may start off simple by training a model which can convert between only 2 weather conditions.
